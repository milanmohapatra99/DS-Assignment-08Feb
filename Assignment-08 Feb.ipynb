    "Ans:- The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users. Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user. \n",

    "Suppose you have subscribed to Amazon Prime Video. So, as a user, all you have to do is sign-up and start interacting with the user interface of the platform. You can select the movie that you want to watch. However, we are not aware of what goes on in the backend – information such as how many movies are stored in their database, or how the data is being used to recommend movies to you. \n",
    "These details are not relevant to the users in general and so are hidden from them.\n"
